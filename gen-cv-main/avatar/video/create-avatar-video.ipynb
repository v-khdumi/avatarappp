You can follow this brief tutorial on how to do so: [Export slides as 1920x1080 PNGs](https://youtu.be/Cv7vGce25rs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively __export the entire presentation as an MP4 video__: If you prefer to use a video instead of static images, PowerPoint offers the option to export your whole animated presentation as an MP4 file.  Here's how you can do it:  \n",
    "Go to __File__ > __Export__ > __Create a Video__ in PowerPoint. Use slide transition and animation durations to adjust timings. The best way to align avatar and content video timing is to use a video editor (Option 2)\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, there are various methods available for integrating the avatar video and the content assets to produce your final video output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Use the FFmpeg command line \n",
